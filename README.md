# Titanic-Dataset-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship â€“ Task 5, where I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal was to explore the data, uncover hidden patterns, and summarize insights using both statistical and visual techniques.

Steps Performed:

Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas (.info(), .describe(), .value_counts()).

Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.

Plotted histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, count plots, heatmaps, and pairplots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Handled missing values (imputed Age with median, Embarked with mode, and dropped Cabin).

Documented observations for each visual and summarized key findings.

 Key Insights:

Only ~38% of passengers survived.

Females had a much higher survival rate compared to males.

First-class passengers had better chances of survival than those in lower classes.

Younger passengers and children showed higher survival rates.

Passengers who paid higher fare were more likely to survive.

 Tools Used:

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn
